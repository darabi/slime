        Preamble to the Gnu Lesser General Public License
        -------------------------------------------------
        Copyright (c) 2000 Franz Incorporated, Berkeley, CA 94704
        
        The concept of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
        ("LGPL") has been adopted to govern the use and distribution of
        above-mentioned application. However, the LGPL uses terminology that
        is more appropriate for a program written in C than one written in
        Lisp. Nevertheless, the LGPL can still be applied to a Lisp program if
        certain clarifications are made. This document details those
        clarifications. Accordingly, the license for the open-source Lisp
        applications consists of this document plus the LGPL. Wherever there
        is a conflict between this document and the LGPL, this document takes
        precedence over the LGPL.
        
        A "Library" in Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions, data and
        foreign modules. The form of the Library can be Lisp source code (for
        processing by an interpreter) or object code (usually the result of
        compilation of source code or built with some other
        mechanisms). Foreign modules are object code in a form that can be
        linked into a Lisp executable. When we speak of functions we do so in
        the most general way to include, in addition, methods and unnamed
        functions. Lisp "data" is also a general term that includes the data
        structures resulting from defining Lisp classes. A Lisp application
        may include the same set of Lisp objects as does a Library, but this
        does not mean that the application is necessarily a "work based on the
        Library" it contains.
        
        The Library consists of everything in the distribution file set before
        any modifications are made to the files. If any of the functions or
        classes in the Library are redefined in other files, then those
        redefinitions ARE considered a work based on the Library. If
        additional methods are added to generic functions in the Library,
        those additional methods are NOT considered a work based on the
        Library. If Library classes are subclassed, these subclasses are NOT
        considered a work based on the Library. If the Library is modified to
        explicitly call other functions that are neither part of Lisp itself
        nor an available add-on module to Lisp, then the functions called by
        the modified Library ARE considered a work based on the Library. The
        goal is to ensure that the Library will compile and run without
        getting undefined function errors.
        
        It is permitted to add proprietary source code to the Library, but it
        must be done in a way such that the Library will still run without
        that proprietary code present. Section 5 of the LGPL distinguishes
        between the case of a library being dynamically linked at runtime and
        one being statically linked at build time. Section 5 of the LGPL
        states that the former results in an executable that is a "work that
        uses the Library." Section 5 of the LGPL states that the latter
        results in one that is a "derivative of the Library", which is
        therefore covered by the LGPL. Since Lisp only offers one choice,
        which is to link the Library into an executable at build time, we
        declare that, for the purpose applying the LGPL to the Library, an
        executable that results from linking a "work that uses the Library"
        with the Library is considered a "work that uses the Library" and is
        therefore NOT covered by the LGPL.
        
        Because of this declaration, section 6 of LGPL is not applicable to
        the Library. However, in connection with each distribution of this
        executable, you must also deliver, in accordance with the terms and
        conditions of the LGPL, the source code of Library (or your derivative
        thereof) that is incorporated into this executable.
