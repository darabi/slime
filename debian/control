Description: Superior LISP Interaction Mode for Emacs
 SLIME is the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs.
 .
 This is an ILISP-like development environment intended for maximum
 integration with CMUCL (also works with SBCL, OpenMCL and work is
 ongoing on Lispworks and current CVS version of CLISP and CLISP 2.32
 on Linux).
 .
 This package contains the Emacs client, that will connect to the
 Lisp-side server (see package cl-swank).
 .
 To connect to Common Lisp implementations not running in Debian
 you need the latest CVS version of slime, NOT the old slime
 'release' version 1.2.1 or older.
