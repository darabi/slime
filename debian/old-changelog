slime (1:1.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * ./debian/rules : now leaving the SLIME 'changelog' file not-gzipped
     see next.
  * ./debian/emacsen-install now symlinking 'changelog' into $ELCDIR/Changelog, 
     - this is required, for the function `slime-changelog-date' to work
     correctly, in slime.el 
  * ./debian/README.Debian : adding a recommendation about using
    '(slime-setup)'
  * these changes are courtesy of a note from Matthew Blakley

slime (1:1.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * well, hey, i'm adding the swank.asd from Slime CVS - but keeping it as
    ./debian/swank.asd, however, so that we won't mistake it as "the real, most
    current, upstream slime.asd", which might ever appear in ./debian/../ again
  * note: this revision should not have the problem about the symlink at 
    /usr/share/common-lisp/systems/swank.asd being to a nonexisting file -
    as, in the prior 1:1.0 revisions, it was.
  * undoing the changes made in the prior revision - uncommenting the
    lines that, in the prior revision, were commented-out in
    ./debian/prerm and ./debian/postinst
  * ./debian/control : use Section: contrib/devel for the source package,
    also

slime (1:1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * ./debian/postinst , ./debian/prerm : comment-out the clc operations
    (there is no swank.asd in slime-1.0.tar.gz)
  * ./debian/prerm : uncomment the previously-commented-out call, to have
    install-info remove the info file

slime (1:1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * ./debian/emacsen-startup : cushion for when 'flavor' is not bound - in
    the style of the ilisp emacsen-startup file
  * ./debian/emacsen-install : symlink source files into the ${ELCDIR} so
    that `find-library' will find them
